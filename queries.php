<h3>This is the cheat sheet to utilizing my technology.</h3>
<h4>Here you can find commonly uncommon queries for searches.</h4>
<pqueries>
If you wish to find something specific, you can type any <i>"phraseyouwish"</i></br>
Doing so like that, should allow you to locate more specific results.</br></pqueries>
</br>
<h4>Lets start simple, a Forced search.</h4>
<pqueries>
Forced searching is as simple as it sounds, just add a plus sign, and experiment. <i>"adam +laverne"</i></br>
Many other engines automatically exclude "where", "how", "and", etc. They call them stop words. We are not implementing stop words in the same way.</br>
Instead we will use it to our advantage to improve results across the board. Add a plus sign and watch the positivity flow.</br>
</pqueries>
</br>
<h4>Next we will talk about ranges. As you know, it dont take much to count to 100.</h4>
<pqueries>
So how can we do that in a search? I am a fan of cryptocurrencies,</br>
Lets try this, "bitcoin $6000..$80000"</br>
A simple change like that, makes all the difference and can increase the speed of research drastically.</br>
</pqueries>
</br>
<h4>Let do one more simple search query then move to more advanced techniques.</h4>
<pqueries>
This one is simple, I just want to find my long lost friend Billy from High School.</br>
My searches will obviously be formatted in the following ways.</br>
First name (or first initial), last name, city (state is optional)</br>
First name (or first initial), last name, state</br>
First name (or first initial), last name, area code</br>
First name (or first initial), last name, zip code</br>
Phone number, including area code</br>
Last name, city, state</br>
Last name, zip code</br>
Simple right? Well, lets take a closer look at this. There is a set field structure to this.</br>
You can swap the fields with anything you want and get combination searches with amazing results.</br>
Now that you know the basics, lets try some more advanced stuff.</br>
</pqueries>
</br></br></br>
<pqueries>
Two Unique but similar tricks also incorporated are highlighting and wildcards.</br>
So if I the developer wanted to look through 50,000 pdf's and extract one specific word,</br>
Perhaps a middle name I do not know,</br>
I would type the following into the search box <i>"'MICHAEL'*'DOUGLAS'"</i> .</br>
If you want to highlight something for the search so it returns better results</br>
You would use something like this: <i>"Something I Need To Find&hl.q=Something More Specific From That Document, Site, Etc. -*"</i></br>
In that search query what I did was term in, highlight something better, than subtract all the wildcard and extra bulk output.</br>
</pqueries>
</br>
  <h4>That is too much information, lets take it back a step.</h4>
  <pqueries>
Okay, Wildcards produce too many results. How do we avoid that?</br>
We will search with the following <i>"'-MICHAEL'*'-DOUGLAS'"</i></br>
This will strip the first and last name, but still match results to</br>
Any results that match the pre and post phrase to minimize results.</br></pqueries>
</br>
  <h4>What if I need to find more than one thing?</h4>
  <pqueries>
Lets say, we just indexed a website, or a book, into the library for searching.</br>
What now? How do I limit my results to one <b>specific title</b> or <b>site/dir</b> ?</br>
Think of the : as your saviour. What we want to do now, is type</br>
the following: <i>"Website.com:phrase/sentence" "booktitle:phrase/sentence"</i></br>
How about matching activity with that? <i>"website1.com site:website2.com"</i></br>
This same principle can be applied to documents as well.</br></pqueries>
</br>
  <h4>Doing that, for the documents, is fun, and tricky.</h4>
  <pqueries>
What we need to do now is explain things a bit more.</br>
The way this works is it catalogs information in arrays in a database.</br>
This is how it is able to match things together and give results.</br>
  <b>Hypothetical Situation:</b>I am sick, I have been sick for a while.</br>
I have been to the doctor and ..... It is time to find the cure myself.</br>
Very common in todays world, people are data mining for solutions without realizing it.</br>
This is how we are going to do this, I will type <i>"Medicine book:'Antibiotics'-*"</i></br>
The results output 3 of 2,357 books, one of which is "Curing a Bacterial Infection at Home"</br>
Another situation is looking for a specific date. Lets have a history lesson.</br></pqueries>
  <div id="historybox"><p2 style="font-size:14px;">
The Birthday of the Supreme Court <i>'September 26th'</i>. The Judiciary Act of 1789 is passed by Congress and signed by President George Washington, </br>
establishing the Supreme Court of the United States as a tribunal made up of six justices who were to serve on the court until death or retirement. </br>
That day, President Washington nominated John Jay to preside as chief justice, and John Rutledge, William Cushing, John Blair, Robert Harrison, </br>
and James Wilson to be associate justices. </br>
On <i>September 26,</i> all six appointments were confirmed by the U.S. Senate.</br>
<b>The U.S. Supreme Court</b> was established by <i>Article 3 of the U.S. Constitution.</i> </br>
The Constitution granted the Supreme Court ultimate jurisdiction over all laws, especially those in which their constitutionality was at issue. </br>
The high court was also designated to oversee cases concerning treaties of the United States, foreign diplomats, admiralty practice, and maritime jurisdiction. </br>
On February 1, 1790, the first session of the U.S. Supreme Court was held in New York Cityâ€™s Royal Exchange Building.</br>
</p2></div></br></br>
  <pqueries>
So I will search for a historical moment, <i>"DAY:DATE Monday:February 1, MONTH:YEAR '1790'&hl.q=sumreme court&-*"</i></br>
  </pqueries>
  <h4>Vice Versa</h4>
  <pqueries>
How do things actually weigh against each other?</br>
Let's try that, <i>"Alcohol vs. Wine"</i></br>
Simple, what it does is weights them against one another and produces a competitive result.</br>
Competition in results are always a good thing with computers. I adore this method and strongly recommend it.</br>
  </pqueries>
</br>
<h4>Defining Your Search, Refining The Result</h4>
<pqueries>
How do we do that? The title of this section is plain and simple.</br>
In order to do this, we do one simple thing, <i>"DEFINE: 'whats on your mind'".</i></br>
As you learn to mix these techniques you can come up with cool stuff like this:</br>
<i>"How To book:'DEFINE: Home Made Solar Panels'-*"</i></br>
We will use the example from the prevoius section and improve upon it next.</br>
<i>"DEFINE:DAY:DATE Monday:February 1, MONTH:YEAR '1790'&hl.q=sumreme court&-*"</i></br>
</pqueries>
</br></br>
<h4>Now that you have learned this, master it, because it will help you refine your search and get better results, even on other engines.</h4>
<pqueries>This was built for my personal Library. However I was asked to provide it for others so I am taking it all the way. I hope you enjoy the work that is to come! Happy Searching!</pqueries></br></div>
