*Official GitHub Etiquette*

---

1. Keep file paths _short_ and sensible.
2. Don't use funky characters and spaces in your file names, these cause trouble because of differences in Mac/Windows systems.
3. Always pull before you push in case someone has done any work since the last time you pulled - you wouldn't want anyone's work to get lost or to have to resolve many coding conflicts.
⋅⋅* Any and all errors you encounter are indeed your own fault for not following this simple process. I will be coding and updating this repository everyday. Pull Push.

*Unofficial "Rules"*

1. If for any reason, you seem to have an issue with something and don't want to file an issue. Please contact me directly.
⋅⋅* I will not be offended or upset. *Discord:Div3y3z#1878*
2. If you decide to use my work, stop by for a while and chat. Id love to hear your ideas. Common Courtesy.
..* I am more than willing to branch this off once a login and UX system is implemented which can train the Solr servers using PiPy's SolrPy using the machine learning.
...* You want to be around for that! Trust me.
3. This is my work, my code, my time invested. If you decide to fork it, remember this is being sent to [https://www.copyright.gov/registration/] and I retain the rights to this work.
4. All third party components and additions will be credited as contribution and distributed as a library pack as long as the _content creators_ agree *100%* that this is okay.
..* If you feel I have used some of your open sources content and you do not want me to, just contact me privately. I will be glad to abide by your wishes.
...* Due to the Open Source nature of this planet right now, I feel a Fair Use Act Notice is justified.
